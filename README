README

This project is a fork of the cs4eclipse (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cs4eclipse/) with various improvements (e.g., automated testing, re-factorings of duplicated code, upgrades based on more recent eclipse standards, additional plug-ins).

The purpose of this project is to provide a means of copying syntax-colored files/text blocks (e.g., Java code) into other formats (e.g., HTML).

This project is based on this maven archetype: http://github.com/timezra/tycho_new_plugin_project

This project can be built from the root pom with standard Maven commands, e.g.,
    $> mvn clean verify

If you would like to build an update site for this project with signed jars use the following commands (the first to generate a self-signed cert with a 1-year validity if you do not have a cert from a CA; the second to activate the maven profile to sign the jars that are packaged in the update site):
    $> keytool -genkey -alias _keystore_alias_ -keystore /path/to/keystore -validity 365
    $> mvn -Psign -Djarsigner.keystore=/path/to/keystore -Djarsigner.storepass=_keystore_password_ -Djarsigner.alias=_keystore_alias_ clean verify

When importing these projects into Eclipse, you should be able to import them as Existing Maven Projects (with the m2e plugin). This should create the appropriate .classpath and .project files.
You may need to delete the timezra.eclipse.codemime tests fragments from the workspace (but not from disk) and then re-import them as a General -> Existing Project after the .classpath and .project files have been created. This might have something to do with their being fragments.

Because of an m2e bug (https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/MNGECLIPSE-966), you may need to set the JRE for the timezra.eclipse.codemime plugins and test fragments to 1.6.

These plug-ins can also be installed from the following update site: http://timezra.github.com/codemime
